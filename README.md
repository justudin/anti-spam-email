This tool was originally conceived and written by Tim Williams of [The University of Arizona](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~trw/spam/spam4.htm). The code to randomly generate a different encryption key each time the tool is used was written by Andrew Moulden of [Site Engineering Ltd](http://www.siteengineering.com). Ross Killen of [Celtic Productions Ltd](http://www.celticproductions.net/articles/10/email/php+email+obfuscator.html) has also created a PHP version to enable use of this technique in web applications.
